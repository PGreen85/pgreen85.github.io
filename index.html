<h3>Simply Notes</h3>

  <h3>About Me</h3>
   <p>
		Why I Develop Free Apps Without Ads
		<br><br>
		My primary goal is to create free Apps that are genuinely helpful and accessible to everyone, regardless of their financial situation. By removing ads, I ensure that users can focus on what truly matters: the functionality and benefits of the software itself.
		<br><br>
		Ads can be distracting, intrusive, and often detract from the user experience. I want my software to provide a seamless, enjoyable experience without any interruptions. Moreover, ads can sometimes pose privacy risks, tracking users' behavior across the internet. By avoiding ads, I can respect users' privacy and build trust.
		<br><br>
		I want to give back to a world that has given me so much in terms of knowledge, inspiration, and collaboration. Developing software without monetary gain allows me to stay true to my values of learning, sharing, and growing together as a community.
		<br><br>
		In short, I create free, ad-free Apps because I believe in fostering a positive, respectful, and accessible digital environment for everyone.
		<br><br>
		However, creating and maintaining quality software takes time and effort. If you find my software helpful and have the means and desire to support my work, you can buy me a coffee :)
